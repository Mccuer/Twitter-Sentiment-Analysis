# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
## Introduction
Twitter(now referred to commonly as X) is one of the most prolific social medias. What makes Twitter unique to many other social platforms is that it is primarily text based. The language used in tweets is full of useful data. 
By using language modeling we can use the data of tweets in a more robust way. One benifit of this is by sentiment modeling. Sentiment modeling allows us to sort tweets by if they are positive, negative, or nuetral. By feeding the model data from tweets that have been marked by sentiment we can train the model to predict the sentiment of new tweets.
